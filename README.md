# Andrew Wright's Dotfiles/Nix Config

I use [nix](https://nixos.org/nix/) and [home manager](https://github.com/rycee/home-manager) to manage my applications and dotfiles.

I use `zsh` as my main shell, customized using `oh-my-zsh`.

## Installation

This repository contains user configuration deployed using the helpful tool [Home Manager](https://github.com/rycee/home-manager). The organisation of my nix files are based on [Hugo Reeves'](https://hugoreeves.com/posts/2019/nix-home). In order to setup a new home space, simply add a home.nix file similar to this one.

```nix
{ config, pkgs, ... }:

{
  # Let Home Manager install and manage itself.
  programs.home-manager.enable = true;

  imports = [
    ./machine/t460.nix
    ./user/awright-personal.nix
    ./role/xmonad-laptop.nix
  ];
}
```

**Programs** contains default setting for various programs & tools.
**Machines** contains configuration specific to a given machine.
**Users** contains configuration specific to a given user, think git config etc.
**Roles** contains the bulk of the configuration and sets up most user space tools, think neovim and your terminal.

## Customize

### Local Settings

The dotfiles can be easily extended to suit additional local requirements by using the following files:

#### `~/.zsh.local`

If the `~/.zsh.local` file exists, it will be automatically sourced. This allows the use of environment variables to store secrets without checking them in.

TODO: look into something like git-crypt
